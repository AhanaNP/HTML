   <p>Chemical Equation :</p>
   <p>2H <sub>2</sub>+ O <sub>2</sub> = 2H <sub>2</sub>O</p>
   <p>CO<sub>2</sub>+ H <sub>2</sub>O  = C<sub>6</sub>H <sub>12</sub>O <sub>6</sub> + O <sub>2</sub></p>
   <p>Algebra Equation : </p>
   <p>(a-b) <sup>2</sup> = a <sup>2</sup> &rarr; 2ab + b <sup>2</sup></p>
   <p>(a+b) <sup>3</sup> = a <sup>3</sup> &rarr; 3a <sup>2</sup> b + 3ab <sup>2</sup> + b <sup>3</sup></p>
